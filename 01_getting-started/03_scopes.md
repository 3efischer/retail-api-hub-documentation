## Scopes

We protect access to our resources and restrict access to the OTTO Retail-API by using OAuth 2.0 scopes.
Scopes allow you to specify which permissions your client application requires.

Currently, all scopes are automatically assigned to your client with your initial request for API access.
Find more information on how to get API access [here](..).

Here is an overview of all available business scopes:

**Production:**
- products

**Sandbox:**
- products-sandbox
