### Getting access

The OTTO Retail-API is only available to suppliers with access to OTTO Supplier Connect. If you are a registered supplier, log into your OTTO Supplier Connect account and request a Retail-API client. Once your request has been processed, you will receive a client ID and client secret, both of which are required for authentication.

If you have any questions, as a registered supplier, open a new ticket in OTTO Supplier Connect via the Helpdesk and select the subcategory "API".

### Getting started

Before you start the implementation, please read the [Getting Started guide](01_getting-started), where you can learn more about the authentication, the different environments and the scopes.

### Implementing the API

To implement the API we offer a sandbox environment which you can use to develop and test the API access. As a first step, please request a client for the sandbox environment. Once you have successfully submitted your data in the sandbox environment please request the client for production use in order to submit your data to OTTO.

To implement the API you find all the necessary information in the detailed API Guide: [About the API](04_products_api)

### Further information

Further general information can be found in the [OTTO API Guidelines](03_api_guidelines/000_index.md) and [About the API](02_about-the-api).
