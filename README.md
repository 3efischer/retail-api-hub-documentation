## Getting access
The OTTO Retail-API is only available to suppliers with access to OTTO Supplier Connect.
If you are a registered supplier, log into your OTTO Supplier Connect account and request a Retail-API client.
Once your request has been processed, you will receive a client ID and client secret, both of which are required for authentication.

If you have any questions, comments or require assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
As a registered supplier, open a new ticket in OTTO Supplier Connect via the Helpdesk and select the subcategory "Weitere Schnittstellen".

Before you start the implementation, please read the [Getting Started](01_getting-started) guide.

For detailed information on how to use our API, see [About the API](02_about-the-api).

Please also refer to the [OTTO API Guidelines](03_api_guidelines/000_index.md).

The OTTO Retail-API specifications can be found in the [References](references) folder.
