# Example product submission JSON

We provide you with a working example JSON for the product submission in order for you to better understand the JSON structure as well as to test your API client application.

The example consists of two products, one with two variants and one with one variant.

In order to use the example, you will have to replace the 

 - the manufacturer product id place holders *{{productReference1}}* and *{{productReference2}}* with your corresponding ids
 - the manufacturer variant id place holders *{{sku1}}*, *{{sku2}}* and *{{sku3}}* with your corresponding ids
 - the ean place holders *{{ean1}}*, *{{ean2}}* and *{{ean3}}* with valid eans

Please take into account that the ids and eans must be unique. If want to submit the example several times you will therefore need to choose/exchange these ids for each submission (unless you want to try out an update of the product/variations).

You can find the example JSON [here][exmple-product.json].
